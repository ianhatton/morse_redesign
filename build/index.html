      <p>
        In the digital world, a system means much more than just a website which is an online brochure for a business. Although we do build lots of those, our real expertise is in building:

        <h1 class='alpha'>About us</h1>
        <p class='epsilon'>
          We are digital media experts who have been delivering real-world client solutions since 1995.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='column_one'>
        <p>
          Our core team comes from an established digital media consultancy, TTT International, established to provide consultancy services to Viacom, Inc.
          <br>
          <br>
          Our clients include major players from global media corporations, Hollywood studios, UK Government departments, communications agencies, and small businesses.
          <br>
          <br>
          We rebranded in October 2011 from TTT International to Morse Digital. It's a "code" thing.

        <h2 class='delta'>Our Approach</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>"Seek first to understand":</em>
            We take a brief then work out what the client requires (not always what the client thinks they require).
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Propose a solution in non-tech terms:</em>
            We like to speak Plain English. Drawing pictures helps, too.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Build a Prototype:</em>
            If there's something innovative or particularly high-tech in the proposed solution, we build a demo before the client commits wholesale to the project. Our prototype-to-full-build ratio is 100% so far.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Agree a plan:</em>
            Little explanation needed here...
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Deliver. On budget:</em>
            We have a little rule we call our "No Surprises" rule. We work to a fixed cost for a fixed project. If the client asks for more, we agree any extra charges in advance. Our clients never receive an invoice they're not expecting.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class='delta'>Testimonials</h2>
        <p>
          "Morse invoices are my favourite to pay. The work is reliable and is consistently delivered on spec, time and budget. Working with Terry was a massive relief after some costly false starts elsewhere. Communication throughout has been easy and enjoyable as he is a gentleman as much as a professional. I continually recommend Morse to others"

        <h1 class='alpha'>Our people</h1>
        <p class='epsilon'>
          Our people are bats.
          Larks rise with the sun. Bats get work done before the larks get out of bed. We're lucky that our people work while others sleep*.
        </p>
        <div class='content_left'>
          <p>
            That doesn't mean we outsource to offshore developers: all Morse people are UK based - they just prefer to work when the phones aren't ringing, which means a LOT of work gets done outside of "office hours".
            <br>
            <br>
            *Of course, we work office hours, too. We're bats, not nuts.

          Gill helps us meet new clients. She's been part of the team since 2011 and has already helped us to grow significantly beyond those clients who have been with us for years. Gill isn't a geek, which helps considerably, as she's able to talk to people in client-speak, and makes sure we do too!
